# ðŸŒ± Changemakrs

Changemakrs is a volunteering tracker app designed to help individuals log, visualize, and reflect on their contributions to their communities. It was inspired by civic tech efforts to encourage public service and make social impact more visible.

## ðŸ§  Why I Built This

Volunteering often goes undocumented, and many people donâ€™t realize the impact theyâ€™ve made over time. I wanted to build a simple tool to track and celebrate community work, especially for youths or students involved in service-learning.

This project is also a personal experiment to learn full-stack development using modern tools like Next.js and Firebase.

## âœ¨ Features

- Add and track volunteering activities
- View a list or timeline of all activities
- Store data securely in the cloud
- Clean, responsive UI

_(Some features are still in development â€” this is an early version of the app.)_

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend/Database:** Firebase
- **Auth (Planned):** Firebase Auth

## ðŸªž Reflections

This was my first full-stack project that focused on solving a social good problem. While there are areas Iâ€™d refactor or design differently now, it taught me a lot about React state management, data modeling, and deployment.

## ðŸ“Œ Status

ðŸš§ In progress â€“ actively working on polish, authentication, and better UI feedback.
