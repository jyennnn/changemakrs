# 🌱 Changemakrs – Celebrating Everyday Volunteers

**Changemakrs** is a personal project built to recognize and celebrate the people behind community work. It started as a simple volunteer tracker — but the real goal has always been to make civic contribution feel visible, valued, and sustainable.

Volunteerism often goes unnoticed. People give their time and energy to causes they care about, but rarely pause to reflect on their impact or receive recognition for it. I wanted to build something that changes that, starting small: a place to log volunteering, see your journey over time, and feel seen for your efforts.

This has also been a meaningful learning journey for me — not just technically, but socially. It’s helped me grow as a developer while exploring how technology can support positive, long-term behavior change.

## ⏸️ Current Status

🚧 **On hold** — waiting for the right opportunity to test this with real users.  
Changemakrs was built to support civic engagement, and I’m pausing active development until I can explore deeper collaboration with schools, youth groups, or volunteer organizations.

The vision is still very much alive — and I plan to return to it when I can build around actual needs and feedback.

## 🪞 Reflection

Changemakrs began with a mission: to go overboard in appreciating volunteers.

Through conversations with friends, non-profit teams, and ground-up initiatives, I realized that celebration often comes at the end of a volunteering journey — if at all. But what if we flipped that? What if we celebrated volunteers **every single time they showed up**, every moment they chose to give their time, energy, and heart?

This project pushed me to think beyond features into behavior design, user motivation, and what it means to build software that genuinely serves. It was also an exercise in product discovery: defining a real-world problem, prototyping a solution, and refining it through feedback from potential users.

Technically, this was my first time working with Supabase and TypeScript in a full-stack production context. I took ownership of the architecture, integrated authentication and database workflows, and made design decisions based on real user needs. It significantly deepened my understanding of modern web app development from UI design to backend logic.

Above all, Changemakrs taught me that meaningful software doesn’t always have to be complex, it just needs to care about the people it’s built for.
